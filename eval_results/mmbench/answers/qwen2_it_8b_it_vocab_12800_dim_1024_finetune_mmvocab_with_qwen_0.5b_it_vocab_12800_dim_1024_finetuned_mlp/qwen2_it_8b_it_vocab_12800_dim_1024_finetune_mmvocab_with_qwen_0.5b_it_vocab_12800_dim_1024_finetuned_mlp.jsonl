Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlunthead cichlids (SIK-lids) are fish that live in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Africa. After a female blunthead cichlid lays eggs, she holds the eggs in her mouth. Once they hatch, her young fish live in her mouth until they are old enough to survive on their own. This process, called mouthbrooding, takes about six weeks.\nWhile mouthbrooding, the female cichlid catches algae from the lake. But she does not swallow any. Instead, she feeds the algae to her offspring by holding it in her mouth for the offspring to eat. By eating the algae, the offspring grow larger and become faster swimmers that can escape predators more quickly.\nFigure: a blunthead cichlid.\nWhy might feeding offspring during mouthbrooding increase the reproductive success of a female blunthead cichlid?

{"question_id": 382, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about passenger pigeons.\nImagine the year 1800. The sky roars with a great clamor, like the sound of a thousand trains. The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.\nB. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.\nC. The migration only happened every one hundred years.\nD. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.", "text": "D", "options": ["The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.", "Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.", "The migration only happened every one hundred years.", "The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds."], "option_char": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "answer_id": "Z2XAXoy84orfiHfPgQWYNp", "model_id": "qwen2_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetuned_mlp", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 386, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about the blue dragon.\nDo dragons exist? Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u201a\u00c4\u00eeunless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA. Their strong fingers squeeze prey.\nB. They have razor-sharp teeth and sharp fingers.\nC. They use weapons to catch food.\nD.

{"question_id": 394, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about capybaras.\nWhat animal looks like a guinea pig and a hippopotamus? The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass.\nB.

Most of these organisms need tropical coral reefs in order to survive and reproduce.\n\nFigure 1: a tropical coral reef.\n\nFigure 2: several types of corals.\nWhich of the following is a characteristic of tropical coral reefs?\nA.

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlunthead cichlids (SIK-lids) are fish that live in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Africa. After a female blunthead cichlid lays eggs, she holds the eggs in her mouth. Once they hatch, her young fish live in her mouth until they are old enough to survive on their own. This process, called mouthbrooding, takes about six weeks.\nWhile mouthbrooding, the female cichlid catches algae from the lake. But she does not swallow any. Instead, she feeds the algae to her offspring by holding it in her mouth for the offspring to eat. By eating the algae, the offspring grow larger and become faster swimmers that can escape predators more quickly.\nFigure: a blunthead cichlid.\nWhy might feeding offspring during mouthbrooding increase the reproductive success of a female blunthead cichlid?

{"question_id": 1000382, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about passenger pigeons.\nImagine the year 1800. The sky roars with a great clamor, like the sound of a thousand trains. The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.\nB. The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.\nC. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.\nD.

{"question_id": 1000386, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about the blue dragon.\nDo dragons exist? Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u201a\u00c4\u00eeunless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA. Their sting is painful and can harm humans.\nB. Their strong fingers squeeze prey.\nC. They have razor-sharp teeth and sharp fingers.\nD.

{"question_id": 1000394, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about capybaras.\nWhat animal looks like a guinea pig and a hippopotamus? The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are large rodents that are powerful swimmers.\nB.

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II assumed the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. As the Isleifur II approached the smoke, the surface of the sea grew rough. The captain and crew saw flashes of lightning in the column of smoke and glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat. It was a volcano erupting under the water!\nFigure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.\nAccording to the text, what evidence of a volcanic eruption did the captain observe?\nA.

{"question_id": 2000382, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about passenger pigeons.\nImagine the year 1800. The sky roars with a great clamor, like the sound of a thousand trains. The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. The migration only happened every one hundred years.\nB. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.\nC. The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.\nD. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.", "text": "B", "options": ["The migration only happened every one hundred years.", "The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.", "The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.", "Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration."], "option_char": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "answer_id": "ks9DdSCictnEEJpUYLn33S", "model_id": "qwen2_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetuned_mlp", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 2000386, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about the blue dragon.\nDo dragons exist? Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u201a\u00c4\u00eeunless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA. They use weapons to catch food.\nB. Their sting is painful and can harm humans.\nC. Their strong fingers squeeze prey.\nD.

{"question_id": 2000394, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about capybaras.\nWhat animal looks like a guinea pig and a hippopotamus? The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are the closest relatives of the hippopotamus.\nB.

{"question_id": 3000382, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about passenger pigeons.\nImagine the year 1800. The sky roars with a great clamor, like the sound of a thousand trains. The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.\nB. The migration only happened every one hundred years.\nC. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.\nD.

{"question_id": 3000386, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about the blue dragon.\nDo dragons exist? Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u201a\u00c4\u00eeunless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA.

{"question_id": 3000394, "round_id": 0, "prompt": "Read the text about capybaras.\nWhat animal looks like a guinea pig and a hippopotamus? The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests.\nB.
