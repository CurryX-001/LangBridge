{"question_id": "5272", "prompt": "<image>\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nPeople with diabetes sometimes take a medicine made from insulin. Insulin can be made by a special type of bacteria. Jasmine was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Jasmine gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nWhich of the following could Jasmine's test show?\nA. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster\nB. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin\nC. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "C", "answer_id": "5zQFFV3Zyda6k494WzKbu9", "model_id": "qwen2.5_it_7b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_llama3_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune", "metadata": {}}
