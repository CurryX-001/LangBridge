One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nEmmy was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Emmy wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Emmy put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Emmy's test show?\nA. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nB. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nC. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "text": "C", "answer_id": "Kzb7koFxh8Qsff5yqraZS9", "model_id": "llama3_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetuned_mlp", "metadata": {}}
