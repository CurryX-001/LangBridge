In France, in 1980, the majority of electricity was produced by coal, followed by natural gas, while in 2000, the majority was still coal, followed by natural gas.\n\nComparing the two countries, it is evident that both countries have a significant dependence on coal as a fuel source for electricity production. However, there is a difference in the proportion of electricity produced by coal in the two countries. In Australia, the proportion of electricity produced by coal has remained relatively constant over the two decades, while in France, the proportion has decreased slightly.\n\nIn addition, the pie charts show that natural gas has become a more important fuel source for electricity production in both countries over the two decades.
