The brown spot is likely caused by a fungal disease called \"berry rot\" or \"strawberry fruit rot.\" This disease affects the fruits of the strawberry plant and can lead to the spoilage of the berries.\n\nTo treat berry rot, it is essential to remove affected fruits promptly to prevent the spread of the fungus. Additionally, maintaining good hygiene practices in the garden, such as regularly cleaning tools and removing dead leaves, can help reduce the risk of infection. It is also important to ensure that the plants have proper air circulation and adequate spacing to minimize humidity levels, which can help prevent the growth of fungi.
