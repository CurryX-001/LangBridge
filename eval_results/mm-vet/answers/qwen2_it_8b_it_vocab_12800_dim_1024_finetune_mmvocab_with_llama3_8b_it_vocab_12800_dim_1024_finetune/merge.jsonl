The immigration line is consistently higher than the emigration line, indicating that more people are moving into the UK than leaving.\n\nIn the early years of the graph, the immigration line was relatively flat, while the emigration line was slightly higher. However, as time passed, the immigration line began to rise steadily, while the emigration line remained relatively stable. This trend continued until 2008 when both lines reached their highest points.\n\nOverall, the graph shows a significant increase in international migration in the UK over the past decade. While the number of people moving into the UK has remained relatively stable, the number of people leaving has decreased, resulting in a net increase in migration.
