One of the strawberries has a brown spot on it, which could be a sign of a fungal disease called \"Botrytis cinerea\" or \"Gray mold.\" This disease is caused by a fungus that thrives in humid conditions and can spread through contact with infected plants or contaminated soil.\n\nTo treat Botrytis cinerea, it is essential to maintain good hygiene practices in the garden, such as removing infected plants and debris promptly. Additionally, proper air circulation and adequate spacing between plants can help reduce humidity levels, making it harder for the fungus to thrive. Regularly pruning the plants and keeping the area around them clean can also help prevent the spread of the disease. In severe cases, fungicides may be necessary to control the infection.
