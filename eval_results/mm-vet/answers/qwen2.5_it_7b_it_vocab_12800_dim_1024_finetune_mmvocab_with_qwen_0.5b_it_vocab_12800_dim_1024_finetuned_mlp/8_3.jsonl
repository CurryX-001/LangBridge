The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) of the gas.

Since both samples have the same number of particles and are in identical closed, rigid containers, they should have the same volume and pressure. However, the average particle speed in Sample B is 600 m/s, which is significantly higher than the 300 m/s in Sample A.\n\nGiven that the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the average particle speed, Sample B must have a higher temperature than Sample A.
