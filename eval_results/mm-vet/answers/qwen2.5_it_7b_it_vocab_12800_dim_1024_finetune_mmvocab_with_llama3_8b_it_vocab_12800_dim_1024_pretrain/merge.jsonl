{"question_id": 100, "prompt": "Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. Which sample has the higher temperature? Sample A or sample B?", "text": "To compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (T) of the gas. This means that if one sample has a higher temperature than the other, its particles will have a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nIn the image, Sample A contains green balls, while Sample B contains blue balls. Since both samples have the same number of particles and are in identical closed, rigid containers, they are at the same pressure. Therefore, the only factor that can affect their average kinetic energy is their temperature.\n\nGiven that the average particle speed in Sample B is 600 m/s, which is higher than the average particle speed in Sample A (300 m/s), it can be inferred that Sample B has a higher temperature than Sample A.
