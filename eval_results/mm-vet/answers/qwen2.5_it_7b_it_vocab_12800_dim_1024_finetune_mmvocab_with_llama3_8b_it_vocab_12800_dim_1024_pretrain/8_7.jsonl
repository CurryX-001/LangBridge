Fungal infections in strawberries can cause the fruits to become deformed or develop mold-like growths on their surface.\n\nTo treat this disease, it is essential to follow proper cultural practices and use appropriate fungicides. Some steps to manage fungal diseases in strawberries include:\n\n1. Remove infected plants and fruits promptly to prevent the spread of the disease.\n2. Practice good sanitation by regularly cleaning tools and equipment used for harvesting and maintaining the plants.\n3. Use organic or chemical fungicides as recommended by local agricultural extension services or plant pathologists. Apply these fungicides at regular intervals, especially during periods of high humidity and rainfall when fungal diseases are more likely to occur.\n4. Maintain proper irrigation and drainage systems to avoid waterlogging, which can exacerbate fungal infections.\n5.

Powdery mildew is a common plant disease that affects various plants, including vegetables and ornamental plants. It causes white or gray powdery growth on the leaves, which can lead to stunted growth, reduced photosynthesis, and even death of the plant if left untreated.\n\nTo treat powdery mildew, it is essential to maintain good hygiene practices in the garden, such as removing infected leaves and pruning affected plants. Regularly watering the plants at the base and avoiding overhead watering can also help prevent the spread of the fungus. Additionally, using organic fungicides like neem oil or baking soda solutions can be effective in controlling the disease.
