The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (T) of the gas. This means that as the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles also increases.\n\nIn the image, Sample A has green balls representing its particles, while Sample B has blue balls representing its particles. Both samples have the same number of particles in identical closed, rigid containers. However, the average particle speed in Sample B is higher than in Sample A.

In contrast, the number of emigrants has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe net migration, which is the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, is also shown on the graph. The net migration was positive in most years, indicating that more people were immigrating to the UK than leaving. However, there was a significant increase in net migration in 2005 and 2006, which could be attributed to the influx of workers from Eastern Europe following the expansion of the European Union.\n\nIn conclusion, the graph shows a steady increase in immigration to the UK over the period, with a slight decrease in emigration.
