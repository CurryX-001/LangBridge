The disease is called \"strawberry leaf scorch,\" which is caused by a bacterial infection. It can cause the leaves to turn yellow, brown, or black, and eventually die. The berries may also be affected, becoming small, deformed, or developing a rough surface.\n\nTo treat strawberry leaf scorch, it is essential to identify the infected plants and remove them promptly to prevent the spread of the disease. Regularly inspecting the plants for signs of infection and removing any affected leaves can help control the spread. Additionally, maintaining good hygiene practices, such as keeping the garden clean and free of debris, can reduce the risk of infection.

The second chart displays the marital status of adult Americans in two specific years, 1970 and 2000.\n\nIn the first chart, it is evident that the number of marriages has been steadily declining over the years, while the number of divorces has been increasing. This trend is particularly noticeable in the 1980s and 1990s. On the other hand, the second chart reveals that the percentage of never married individuals has increased significantly over the years, while the percentage of married individuals has decreased. Additionally, the percentage of divorced individuals has also increased, but at a slower rate than the increase in the number of divorces.\n\nComparing the two charts, it can be observed that the decline in marriage rates is closely linked to the increase in divorce rates. This suggests that people are becoming more independent and less reliant on marriage as a means of social support and companionship. Furthermore, the increase in the number of never married individuals indicates that people are delaying marriage or choosing not to marry at all, which could be due to various factors such as changing attitudes towards marriage, economic instability, and the rise of alternative forms of social support.\n\nOverall, the charts provide valuable insights into the changing patterns of marriage and divorce in the USA over the past few decades.
