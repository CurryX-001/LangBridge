On the other hand, the number of emigrants has been relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease in 2003 and 2004. The net migration has also been on an upward trend, with the highest value recorded in 2007. The total population has increased slightly over the years, but the rate of increase has been slower than the rate of immigration.\n\nComparing the data for the years 1999 and 2008, it can be observed that the number of immigrants has increased by approximately 50%, while the number of emigrants has remained relatively stable. The net migration has also increased significantly, from around 100,000 in 1999 to over 200,000 in 2008. The total population has increased by around 10% over the same period.\n\nOverall, the graph shows a significant increase in the number of immigrants and net migration in the UK over the past decade, which has led to an increase in the total population.", "answer_id": "Lroi3dmrQ3PxQZbvfNpDCf", "model_id": "qwen2_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_pretrain", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": 210, "prompt": "The charts below give information about USA marriage and divorce rates between 1970 and 2000, and the marital status of adult Americans in two of the years.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words.", "text": "The charts below provide information on the marriage and divorce rates in the USA between 1970 and 2000. The first chart shows the number of marriages and divorces per 1,000 population for each year in this period. The second chart displays the marital status of adult Americans in two specific years, 1970 and 2000.\n\nIn the first chart, it is evident that the number of marriages has been steadily declining over the years, while the number of divorces has been increasing. This trend is particularly noticeable in the 1980s and 1990s. On the other hand, the second chart reveals that the percentage of never married individuals has increased significantly over the years, while the percentage of married individuals has decreased. Additionally, the percentage of divorced individuals has also increased, but at a slower rate than the increase in the number of divorces.\n\nComparing the two charts, it can be observed that the decline in marriage rates is closely linked to the increase in divorce rates. This suggests that people are becoming more independent and less reliant on marriage as a means of social support and companionship. Furthermore, the increase in the number of never married individuals indicates that people are delaying marriage or choosing not to marry at all, which could be due to various factors such as changing attitudes towards marriage, economic instability, and the rise of alternative forms of social support.\n\nOverall, the charts provide valuable insights into the changing patterns of marriage and divorce in the USA over the past few decades. They highlight the need for policymakers to address the complex social and economic factors that have contributed to these changes and to develop policies that promote healthy relationships and support for individuals and families.", "answer_id": "UXpKYrmseJSqDY2DmupzRL", "model_id": "qwen2_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_pretrain", "metadata": {}}
