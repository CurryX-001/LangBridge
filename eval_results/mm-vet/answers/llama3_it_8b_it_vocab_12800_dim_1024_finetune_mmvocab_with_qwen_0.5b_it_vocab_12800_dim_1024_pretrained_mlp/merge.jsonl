The majority of the migration to the UK has come from European countries, with the highest number of migrants coming from Poland, followed by Romania, Bulgaria, and Ireland. The migration from non-European countries has been relatively low, with the highest number of non-European migrants coming from India, followed by Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.\n\nOverall, the graph provides a clear picture of the long-term migration trends to the UK, highlighting the steady decline in migration rates over the years, as well as the predominantly European origin of the migrants.", "answer_id": "N8KeeGCFzMFaWj7ReRW5Jy", "model_id": "llama3_it_8b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_finetune_mmvocab_with_qwen_0.5b_it_vocab_12800_dim_1024_pretrained_mlp", "metadata": {}}
